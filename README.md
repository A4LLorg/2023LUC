CHAPTER 1. INTENT, INTERPRETATION & DECISION MAKERS
Section 1. Title; Short Title
This document shall be titled the Delta County Land Use Code and referred to as “this Code”.
Section 2. Purpose; Interpretation; Authority; Jurisdiction
A. Purpose.
1. Generally. The purposes of this Code are to:
a. Promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of Delta
County;
b. Protect the character of existing rural communities, urban communities and
neighborhoods in Delta County;
c. Ensure that developers and subdividers provide adequate, safe, and efficient
public utilities and public improvements, and provide for other community facilities,
and including land for public places and uses; and
d. Establish adequate and accurate records of land subdivision.
B. Interpretation
1. Generally.
a. Delta County has a strong commitment to private property rights, as set out in the
County’s Master Plan. The freedom to use private property is not just in the owner’s
interest of private landowners, but also in the general public interest. However; the
physical impacts of the use of private property on surrounding properties, public
infrastructure, and/or natural resources is a matter of County concern, and
therefore a proper subject of County regulation.
b. The right to develop and improve private property does not include the right to
physically damage or adversely impact neighboring landownersproperties, or to
utilize more than the property owner’s fair share of public facilities and resources,
even if that means that the property owner cannot utilize property for its perceived
“highest and best use.”
c. Zoning provides an efficient and fair way to provide for the orderly use and
development of land in the County. Land uses that generate noise, dust, traffic or
other potential off-site impacts are directed by this Code to certain zoning districts
where there are adequate services (including roads, water, and sewerwastewater
treatment/disposal), and where off-site impacts may be more effectively absorbed
and/or mitigated.
d. This Code is designed to increase understanding among landowners, residents,
business owners, and decision-makers as to the boundaries separation between
private property rights and public interests in various areas of the County. This
Code establishes a regulatory format for what it means to be a “good neighbor” in
Delta County in terms of the use and development of land.
e. This Code was developed in the context of, and subject to, constitutionally protected
rights, which are articulated in the Constitutions of the United States and the State of
Colorado and interpreted by federal and state courts with jurisdiction in and over
Delta County. Further, this Code was developed in the context of constitutional and
statutory provisions that both establish and limit the authority of the County
government in Colorado.
2. Relationship to Policy and Land Use Plans. It is the intent of this Code to implement the
policies outlined in the Master Plan, as well as other policy documents adopted prior or
subsequent to the adoption of this Code. However, neither this Code nor any amendments
thereto may be challenged on the basis of any alleged inconsistency or nonconformity with
any policy document.
3. Permits Issued in Conflict with Code. Any permit issued in conflict with the provisions of
this Code shall be null and void, and shall not be construed as waiving any provision of this
Code, except in such cases where a waiver or modification is expressly authorized by
variance or other comparable procedures set out herein. No oversight or dereliction of any
office or employee of the County shall legalize, authorize, or excuse any violation of any
provision of this Code. No legal, vested, or equitable rights shall be acquired under any
invalid zoning or subdivision approval.
4. Basic Requirements. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Code
shall be regarded as the basic requirements for the protection of public health, safety,
comfort, convenience, prosperity, and welfare. This Code shall be interpreted in order to
further its underlying purposes.
5. Construction with Other Laws. Whenever any provision of this Code or any provision of
any other law, rule, contract, resolution, ordinance, or regulation of the County, State, or
Federal government contains certain standards covering the same subject matter, the
interpretation that gives effect to all of the applicable laws controls unless County
jurisdiction is preempted. Generally, that means that the more restrictive requirements or
higher standards control the decision.
C. Authority and Jurisdiction
1. Authority and Specific Limitations. This Code is authorized and limited by the following
state laws:
a. C.R.S. § 24-6-401, et seq. (Open Meetings Law)
b. C.R.S. § 24-65.5-101, et seq. (Notification of Surface Development);
c. C.R.S. § 24-67-101, et seq. (Planned Unit Development Act of 1972);
d. C.R.S. § 24-68-101, et seq. (Vested Property Rights)

Act)
g. C.R.S. § 29-20-101, et seq. (Local Government Land Use Control Enabling Act)
h. C.R.S. § 29-20-201, et seq. (Regulatory Impairment of Property Rights)
i. C.R.S. § 29-20-301, et seq. (Adequate Water Supply)
j. C.R.S. § 30-28-101, et seq. (County Planning);

l. C.R.S. § 31-23-212 (Implementation of Municipal Major Street Plan)
m. C.R.S. § 43-2-301, et seq. (Vacation Proceedings)
2. Additional Authority and Limitations. The citations above are expansive, but not
necessarily complete. As such, in addition to the specific authorities and limitations set out
above, other statutes may be referenced herein or otherwise utilized as the basis for
regulations, procedures, or definitions set out in this Code.
3. General Limitations.
a. No part of this Code shall be interpreted in a manner that irreconcilably conflicts
with a Colorado statute. See C.R.S. § 30-15-411.
b. Regulations and restrictions of the height, number of stories, size of buildings and
other structures, and the height and location of trees and other vegetation shall not
apply to existing buildings, structures, trees, or vegetation except for new growth on
such vegetation. See C.R.S. § 30-28-118(2)(c).
c. The application of this Code may be further limited by existing or future federal law
that preempts County jurisdiction or authority (e.g., the U.S. Constitution, the U.S.
Code, or the Code of Federal Regulations).
4. Jurisdiction. This Code applies within the unincorporated Delta County, Colorado.
Section 3. Transitional Provisions
A. Effect on Pending Applications
1. Generally. An application for approval of a site-specific development plan, as well as the
approval, conditional approval, or denial of approval of such plan, shall be governed only by
the duly adopted laws and regulations in effect at the time the complete application is
submitted. See C.R.S. § 24-68-102.5, Applications - Approval by Local Government.
2. Immediate Public Health and Safety Exception. The County may adopt a new or
amended ordinance or regulation, when necessary, for the immediate preservation of public
health and safety, and may enforce such ordinance or regulation in relation to applications
pending at the time such ordinance or regulation is adopted.
See C.R.S. § 24-68-102.5, Applications - Approval by Local Government.
B. Effect on Approvals that Pre-Date the Effective Date
1. Generally. Development that was approved by the County prior to the effective date of this
Code, but not completed as of the effective date, may be carried out within the scope of the
development approval, provided that the approval is valid and has not lapsedexpired. Work
that is authorized must be commenced during the period in which the permit is valid, and
then diligently pursued to completion.
2. Duration of Development Approvals.
a. Development approvals and permits that are valid on the effective date of this Code,
but for which no further action has been taken with respect to permitting,
construction, or establishment of a land use are valid until the stated expiration
date, which may be on the face of the permit or development approval, or within
related documents such as development agreements or regulations in force on the
date of the approval.
b. The Director may grant an extension of up to one (1) year for the approvals and
permits listed above for good cause shown, provided that a written request for the
extension is filed with the Director not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration date of the approval or permit.
3. Scope of Development Approvals. This shall not be interpreted to confer rights upon an
applicant that are not set out within the scope of a development approval or permit.
4. Conditions of Prior Approvals or Permits. All conditions of development approvals or
permits that were granted or issued prior to the effective date of this Code remain in force
according to their own terms, regardless of the standards or requirements of this Code.
Conditions of approval may be modified or eliminated by amendment to the development
agreement, resolution, or permits through which the conditions were imposed.
5. Approvals that are Abandoned. Development previously approved by development
agreement that have not begun the use approved for within 12 months of this code Delta
County where the use did not begin by January 5, 2021 shall be considered abandoned
unless the development agreement specifically provides otherwise.
6. Effect of Termination of Approval. Approvals that terminate pursuant to this become void
on the date of termination, and no further development approvals or permits may be issued
in reliance upon them. No application for an extension or modification of an approval or
permit will be accepted after termination of the approval or permit for which extension or
modification is sought.
C. Effect of Developmenton Existing Agreements
This Code does not affect existing, executed Development Agreements, Subdivision Improvements
Agreements, Public Improvements Agreements, or other agreements, however titled, between the
County and a landowner or applicant, except as may be provided therein or by applicable state or
federal law.
Delta County Land Use Code Page 21
D. Effect on “Specific Development Approvals”
1. Generally. Property that is subject to an approved Specific Development pursuant to the
former DELTA COUNTY REGULATION FOR SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENTS, AS AMENDED, dated January 22,
2019 (repealed by this Code), may be developed in accordance with the Specific
Development approval during the term of the Specific Development approval.
2. Modifications to an Existing Specific Development Approval. Specific Development
approvals may be modified by amendment to the development agreementdocument that
controls the Specific Development. Such amendments shall be consistent with the
requirements of this Code. The Board of County Commissioners may agree to terminate a
Development Agreement related to a Specific Development approval and allow the use to be
addressed as provided in this Code.
E. Effect on Existing Violations
1. Generally. Any violation of the regulations that were repealed and replaced upon adoption
of this Code (see Chapter 1, Section 4) shall be treated as follows:
a. If a violation occurred prior to the effective date and continued past the effective
date, then the County may pursue remedies for each day of violation, based on the
applicable ordinances or resolutions that were in effect on each day that the
violation occurred.
b. If a violation occurred prior to the effective date, but the same activity is no longer a
violation after the effective date, then the County may pursue remedies for each day
of the violation, based on the ordinances or resolutions that were in effect on each
day prior to the effective date during which the violation occurred.
2. Fines and Penalties. Payment of fines shall be required for any civil penalty assessed prior
to the effective date (under the formerly applicable ordinances or resolutions), even if the
original violation is no longer considered a violation under this Code.
F. No Effect on Existing Easements, Covenants, or Agreements
1. Generally. This Code does not modify, abrogate, or annul any easement, covenant, plat
note, or any other agreement related to the use or development of land if the easement,
covenant, or agreement pre-dates the effective date and does not contemplate modifications
based on future changes to County ordinances and resolutions.
2. No Effect on Private Restrictions.
a. Generally. This Code does not change or override private restrictions on property.
This Code will be enforced on property that is subject to private restrictions in the
same manner as other properties.
b. No Duty to Search for Private Restrictions. The County has no duty to search for the
existence of private restrictions on property. In the review of applications pursuant
to this Code, the County will enforce only its own regulations and agreements to
which it is a party or has an interest.
3. No Duty to Interpret or Apply Private Restrictions.
a. The County will not interpret, apply, or enforce private restrictions or agreements
(e.g., homeowners’ association covenants, or private road maintenance agreements,
water rights). However, the County may interpret or apply private restrictions
(which may include placing conditions on, or denying, development approvals) if:
1.1.1.a.1.1) It is a party to them, and as a party, the County determines that interpretation or
application is necessary or appropriate; or
1.1.1.a.1.2) The private restrictions are a conservation easement provided to a third party, and either:
1.1.1.a.1.2.a) The third-party easement holder objects to the proposed development on the basis
that it is inconsistent with the terms of the conservation easement; or
1.1.1.a.1.2.b) The County otherwise finds that theat proposed development is inconsistent with
the terms of the conservation easement.
b. When the County zones or rezones property or otherwise issues a development
approval, such action:
1.1.1.a.1.1) Shall not be considered an interpretation regarding existing private restrictions to which
the County is not a party; and
1.1.1.a.1.2) With respect to conservation easements, the County’s interpretation shall not bind the
easement holder (if different from the County).
c. Parties to covenants who seek permits or development approvals from the County
that are inconsistent with the covenants do so at their own risk that the covenants
may be enforced by other parties who may have standing to file suit.
4. No Duty to Enforce Private Restrictions. The County will not generally seek to enforce
private restrictions. The County may become involved in the enforcement of private
restrictions only if:
a. The County is a party to or has an explicit right of enforcement set out in the
restrictions; or
b. The County determines that enforcement is in the interest of the County as a whole;
and the County finds that it is likely to have legal standing to enforce the private
restrictions; or
c. In the case of conservation easements, the County may take action to rescind or
modify a development approval if either:
1.1.1.a.1.1) The applicant failed to disclose the existence of a conservation easement over the subject
property during the development approval process; or
1.1.1.a.1.2) A court adjudicates that the development approval is inconsistent with an applicable
conservation easement and prohibits the applicant from proceeding with development pursuant to
said development approval.
Delta County Land Use Code Page 23
G. Existing Public Utility Facilities
None of the provisions of this Code shall apply to any existing building, structure, or plant, or other
equipment owned or used by a public utility. After the effective date of this Code, all extensions,
betterments, or additions to buildings, structures, or plant or other equipment of a public utility
shall only be made in conformity with this Code, unless the Public Utilities Commission orders
(pursuant to C.R.S. § 30-28-127) that such extensions, betterments, or additions to buildings,
structures, or plants or other equipment are reasonable and that such extensions, betterments, or
additions may be made even though they conflict with this Code.
Section 4. Effective Date; Repealer; Severability
A. Effective Date; Repealer
1. Generally. These Development Regulations shall be effective following adoption by the
Board of County Commissioners of Delta County. Upon the Effective Date of approval of
these Development Regulations, the DELTA COUNTY SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS 2008 AMENDED,
dated January 22, 2019, the DELTA COUNTY REGULATION FOR SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENTS AMENDED dated
September 3, 2019, Mobile Home Park regulations amended in 1997, any and all planning
districts or protection plans adopted including, but not limited to, the Surface Creek Land

Chapter 2. ZONING DISTRICTS AND LAND USE
Section 1. Establishment of Zoning Districts
A. Purpose and Establishment of Zoning Districts
1. Purpose.
a. Relationship to Master Plan. This Code is designed to bring Delta County’sestablishes
land use regulations into that are consistentcy with the 2018 Delta County Master
Plan. The Master Plan identified a need to create a simple, clear, fair, and predictable
set of regulations. The Master Plan This Code is meant also identified a need to
provide clarity and assurances fairness for residents and property owners, and
more predictability for commercial activities in the County.
b. Land Use in General. This Code is designed to clarify where commercial, industrial,
agricultural, and residential uses are most appropriately located around the County.
c. Commercial Land Uses. This Code identifies the range of commercial uses that are
anticipated in the County, and further identifies zoning districts in which each type
of commercial use is appropriate or may be appropriate if certain conditions are
met. Generally, commercial uses are most appropriately located in the RI/RC zoning
district and UGA zoning districtsoverlay. However, most of the other zoning districts
allow for multiple land uses and sufficient flexibility such that a wide range of
commercial land uses may be located almost anywhere where adequate services can
be provided, and standards of this Code can be met.
2. Zoning Districts Established. In order to carry out the provisions of this Code, the County
is divided into the following zoning districts:
TABLE 2.a
ZONING DISTRICTS
ABBREVIATION ZONING DISTRICT
NAME
PURPOSES
A-35 Agriculture (35-
acre)
This zoning district is intended for to reflect lands with
significant natural resources, including prime
agricultural lands. and rural residential uses The intent
is to retain irrigated lands on larger parcels that are
generally thirty-five or more (35+) acres. It allows for
the broadest range of agricultural and supporting uses.
A-20 Agriculture (20-
acre)
This zoning district is intended for small-scale
agricultural rural residential uses on parcels of land that
are generally twenty or more (20+) acres. It allows for
a broad range of agricultural and supporting uses as
well as large-lot residential uses.
A-5 Agriculture (5-
acre)
This zoning district is intended for small-scale
agricultural and large-lot residential uses.
A-2.5 Agriculture (2.5-
acre)
This zoning district is intended for small-scale
agricultural and rural residential uses in areas that will
not impact irrigated lands and where there is an
adequate water supply and access available.
RES-1 Residential
(1-acre)
This zoning district is intended for residential uses in
areas suitable for such density, including potential
access to infrastructure and services (e.g., public water,
sewer, fire hydrants, etc.).
RI/C Rural Industrial /
Commercial
This zoning district is intended to provide for rural
industries that support farming and resource-based
industries, or that otherwise benefit from locating
outside of municipal boundaries (e.g., minerals
processing, oil and gas services, etc., but not including
oil and gas services)., as well as In addition, the
designation can be used for a range of commercial uses
in areas near municipalities where there are sufficient
services and infrastructure to accommodate them.
UGA Urban Growth Area
Overlay
This zoning district overlay applies to areas near
incorporated municipalities, and provides a way for
where urban services (e.g., public water and sewer) are
available, and have been identified as areas of potential
growth by the municipality through an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the
County and each City/Town. This overlay highlights
areas where the County to will work with the
municipalities to achieve ordered urban and suburban
growth (e.g., higher residential densities and
commercial/service uses). Areas around municipalities
that are intended for new or continuing agricultural
uses, or rural commercial/industrial development
include active agricultural operations should not be in
the zoned UGA overlay.
P/QP Public/QuasiPublic
This zoning designation reflects public lands (e.g.,
Forest, BLM, Park), public safety facilities (fire, medical,
law), public schools, and utilities (water, wastewater,
electricity, etc.)
B. Official Zoning Map Adopted
1. Official Zoning Map Adopted. The boundaries of zoning districts are shown upon the map
entitled “Official Zoning Map of Delta County, Colorado” (referred to hereinafter as “Zoning
Map”) which is incorporated into and made part of this Code by this reference.
Delta County Land Use Code Page 31
2. Force and Effect. The Zoning Map and all notations, references, and other information
shown on it are a part of this Code and have the same force and effect as this Code.
3. Status of Zoning Map. The Zoning Map that is on file at the Planning Department shall
control in the event of a conflict between the map that is on file and any other reproduction
of said map, including but not limited to, maps that are made available electronically.
C. Interpretation of and Updates to Zoning Map
1. Generally.
a. Updates to the Zoning Map shall be made administratively following approval of a
rezoning by the Board of County Commissioners.
b. Technical changes to the Zoning Map that are necessary to correct the map and
ensure that it accurately reflects zoning district boundaries previously approved
shall also be made administratively.
c. The precise location of any zoning district boundary line shown on the Zoning Map
shall be defined by the rules of subsections (2), (3), (4), and (5) below, applied
sequentially until the location is identified. Zoning designations are presumed to
extend to the centerline of an abutting roadway.
2. Rezoning Resolutions.
a. The process and approval standards for rezoning property is in Chapter 8, Section 3
of this Code, except as provided in this Section.
b. Once approved by the Board of County Commissioners, rRezoning resolutions shall
be promptly reflected on the Zoning Map. The boundaries of property that are
specified in a rezoning resolution are controlling, except as provided in this
subsection.
c. Conflicts between the zoning district boundaries on the Zoning Map and the zoning
for property provided by an adopted rezoning resolution dated after the effective
date of this Code could result from administrative, cartographic, or scrivener’s
errors. In the event of such conflict:
1.1.1.a.1.1) It is presumed that the adopted rezoning resolution controls, and the Zoning Map shall be
promptly corrected when the conflict is identified. The Director shall provide written notice of the
correction to the owners of property that is the subject of a Zoning Map correction.
1.1.1.a.1.2) The presumption may be rebutted if it is obvious that the error is within the text of the
rezoning resolution, in that:
1.1.1.a.1.2.a) The rezoning affects property that was not the subject of the application for
rezoning; or
1.1.1.a.1.2.b) The rezoning affects only a portion of the property that was the subject of the
application, the application requested rezoning for the entire property, and the application was
granted without conditions that restricted the extent of the rezoning.
3. Identifiable Features. In the absence of a rezoning resolution that specifies parcel
boundaries, where zone boundary lines appear to follow identifiable features, their location
shall be determined by applying the rules of this subsection in order from (a) to (i):
a. Rights-of-Way. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following,
roads, alleys, railroad tracks, or utility lines shall be construed as following the
centerline of the right-of-way. Where the location of the actual roads or alleys
differs from the location of corresponding roads or alleys on the Zoning Map, the
location of the actual roads or alleys controls.
b. Municipal or County Boundaries. Boundary lines shown as following, or
approximately following, municipal or County boundary lines shall be construed as
following such lines.
c. Property Lines. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, lot
lines or other property lines shown on the Zoning Map shall be construed as
following such lines.
d. Floodplains. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following,
floodplain boundary lines shall be construed as following such lines.
e. Service Area Boundaries. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately
following, special district service area boundary lines shall be construed as
following such lines.
f. Toe or Top of Slope. Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following,
the toe or the top of a steep slope, shall be construed as following the contour line of
the toe or top of slope.
g. Watercourses. Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, the
centerline of streams, canals, or other watercourses shall be construed as following
the channel centerline.
h. Parallel to Features. Boundaries shown as materially separated from, or shown
within a set distance from, any of the boundaries or features listed in paragraphs (a)
through (g), above, shall be construed to be separated from such features at such
distances as are shown by the scale on the Zoning Map.
i. Changes in the Location of Identifiable Features. Generally, the location of identifiable
features that are used to identify zoning district boundaries shall be the location of
the features on the date that the zoning district was assigned or changed. However,
in the event of a natural change in the location of streams or other watercourses, the
zoning district boundary shall be construed as moving with the channel centerline,
and such movement shall not render existing development nonconforming.
4. Unsubdivided Land or No Identifiable Feature. In the absence of a rezoning resolution
that specifies parcel boundaries, on unsubdivided land, or where a district boundary follows
no identifiable feature, the location of zone boundaries shall be determined by applying the
following rules in sequential order until the boundaries are known:
Delta County Land Use Code Page 33
a. Text Dimensions. The boundary shall be located by reference to dimensions shown
in text on the Zoning Map, if any.
b. Map Scale. The boundary shall be located using the map scale appearing on the
Zoning Map.
5. All Land Within the Unincorporated County Shall Be Zoned. It is the intent of the Board
of County Commissioners that all land within the unincorporated areas of the County shall
be zoned. Accordingly, the A-35 zoning district shall be applied to all land on the Zoning
Map that is not the subject of one of the situations identified in subsections (2), (3), or (4),
above, and:
a. Within the unincorporated area of the County;
b. Not within a public right-of-way; and
c. Not shown within the boundaries of a particular zoning district on the Zoning Map.

type of development that is proposed. The principal objective of this Section is to ensure
that the various elements of proposed development are appropriately configured.
a. Application of Section. This Section applies to development for which a sketch plan,
Site Plan, Preliminary Plat, or Final Plat is required.
b. Designation of Stewardship Areas. All sketch plans, Site Plans, Preliminary Plats, and
Final Plats shall designate “stewardship” areas to comply with the requirements of
this Code and specifically Chapter 4 Site Design and Environmental Stewardship.
c. Stewardship Areas. Stewardship areas are those areas that are designated to protect
irrigated agriculture, irrigation infrastructure, passive outdoor recreation activities,
open space, wildlife, or environmental resources from development or disturbance.
Grading, wells, fencing, retaining walls, landscaping, vegetation removal or
disturbance, and other activities or construction that are consistent with such
stewardship (e.g., thinning of vegetation for wildfire mitigation, irrigation
infrastructure, habitat or wildlife migration corridor mitigation or restoration, weed
control or invasive species control, nature trails, etc.) are allowed in stewardship
areas subject to the standards of this Code.
B. General Design Objectives
1. Generally. The design objectives of this are intended to result in plans for development or
redevelopment that reflect high quality design, but not to require a reduction of
development potential to less than is allowed by this Code.
2. Application. These objectives are to be applied to new development to the extent that:
a. They do not directly conflict with the other requirements of this Code;
b. They do not result in conditions of approval that prevent a permitted use of a
subject property that complies with the other standards of this Code; and
c. They are used in ways that ensure development is done in a manner that takes into
account the unique natural features of a site, as well as its available or required
infrastructure and services.
3. Design Objectives. The design of new development shall:
a. Coordinate with surrounding property with regard to the alignment of road rightsof-way, utility and drainage easements, open space, and wildlife habitat
conservation; and minimize interference with existing access to adjacent and nearby
properties, unless new and improved access is provided by the proposed
development;
b. Minimize impacts to surface and subsurface water quality from runoff, erosion, or
discharge of pollutants;
c. Protect and enhance natural and historic resources through incorporation of natural
topographic and geologic features and historic, archaeological, and/or natural
resources in ways that are consistent with their preservation or stewardship;
d. Avoid impervious cover over, or erosion of, prime agricultural soils and sensitive
lands; and
e. Implement master street plans, as applicable.
Section 2. Roads, Access, and Circulation
A. Purpose and Application of Section
1. Generally. Development shall be designed as set out in this Section (and this Chapter 4), as
applicable to the type of development that is proposed. This Section is intended to be
consistent with DELTA COUNTY ROADWAY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS and Colorado
Department of Transportation Standards. In the event there is a conflict, the Director, in
consultation with the County Engineer, will determine the appropriate standard to apply
based on conditions of the site and surrounding area. The principal objective of this Section
is to ensure that the roads, access points, and internal circulation systems of a development
are appropriately designed to promote public health and safety, mobility, and the efficient
use of land.
2. Application of Section. This Section applies to development for whichinvolving a sketch
plan, Site Plan , preliminary plat, or subdivisionfinal plat is required.
B. Access to State Highway System Required
1. Generally. No person may submit an A Development Aapplication for preliminary or final
plat approval unless the plat provides, pursuant to C.R.S. § 43-2-147, is required to provide
documentation that all lots and parcels created by the subdivision included as part of the
project does or will have adequate access to the state highway system in conformance with
the state highway access code. See C.R.S. § 30-28-133.1 a public or private road in
conformance with applicable access/road standards.
2. Access Permits. All connections to County Roads, State Highways, or Federal
Roads/Highways shall be authorized by an Access Permit issued by the entity that controls
access to the road or highway. A copy of the Access Permit is a prerequisite to sketch plan,
site plan, or final plat approval required to be submitted as part of the Development
Application.
C. Circulation Objectives
1. Internal Circulation.
Delta County Land Use Code Page 89
a. Interconnection. Circulation systems (roads and driveways) within a subject
property shall be interconnected.
b. Alternate Routes of Travel. If proposed development includes more than one (1)
road or more than one hundred (100) parking spaces, then the internal circulation
system shall be designed such that alternative travel routes are provided through
the development.
2. Private Access-Generally.
a. Relationship to Overall Site Design. Access to parking areas shall be designed and
constructed to facilitate the flow of traffic, provide maximum safety of traffic ingress
and egress, and safety for traffic on the subject property.
b. Number of Access Points. In general, each lot or parcel is allowed one (1) point of
access. the number ofAdditional access point(s) to a subject property may be
considered if the County Engineer determines that it meets DELTA COUNTY ROADWAY
 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS and the access is needed to allowshall be limited
to the minimum number that:
1.1.1.a.1.1) Will allow Tthe property to accommodate the traffic to be anticipated; or
1.1.1.a.1.2) Will allow for Aaccess by emergency services, or for evacuation of the subject property in
the event of a fire or flood hazard, if the risk of such hazards is elevated due to the location of the
subject property;. or
1.1.1.a.1.3) Temporary access for agricultural operations.
c. Location of Access Points. Access points to individual properties shall not be located
closer than 15 ft. to an interior side lot linewithin the property boundary, except
where there is that a common shared access easement by to two (2) adjoining
properties may be provided at the shared lot line. Access points shall be located and
configured such that normal maintenance, including dust control and snow removal,
will not damage livestock or boundary fences (livestock or boundary).
d. Further Restrictions. Additional restrictions on access to State and County roads may
be imposed by the DELTA COUNTY ROADWAY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS and
Colorado Department of Transportation rules Access shall be shown on Plats and
Site Plans (existing and proposed). Where there is a shared access, the entire extent
of access shall be illustrated with appropriate easements.
e. Street Plans (35-Acre Plus Subdivisions). All plans of streets or highways for public
use, and all plans, plats, plots and replots of land laid out in subdivision or building lots
and the streets, highways, alleys or other portions of the same intended to be
dedicated to a public use or the use of purchasers or owners of lots fronting thereon or
adjacent thereto shall be submitted to the Board of County Commissioners, for review
and subsequent approval, conditional approval, or disapproval pursuant to C.R.S. 30-
28-110(3)(a). This applies to subdivisions of all parcels of land, regardless of size of
the parcels within the subdivision. Street Plans shall be required for development
and subdivision of all parcels of land, regardless of size of the parcels (including 35+
acre divisions of land), where the property fronts onto, and requires access from, a
public Right-of-Way and/or where the development includes internal roads that are
intended to be dedicated for public use. Said Plan shall be submitted to the Board of
County Commissioners, for review and subsequent approval, conditional approval,
or disapproval. It is not lawful to record any such Plan or Plat in any public office

language shall be included in covenants, conditions, and restrictions, and on the
Final Plat, to ensure that the partition fences are maintained by the lot owners or
the homeowners’ association at all times that the adjoining land is used for
agricultural purposes.
5. Plat Notes. Where a non-agricultural subdivision is created adjacent to land used for
agricultural purposes, a note shall be included on the Final Plat that indicates that the
adjacent property is used for agricultural, and a right-to-farm disclaimer (See Chapter 12;
Section 5(I)). in the following form shall be included on the plat:
NOTICE TO LOT PURCHASERS. As of the date of this final plat, adjacent property is
used for agricultural purposes. The land within this plat may be
impacted by agricultural activities, including but not limited to
noise from tractors and equipment; slow-moving farm vehicles on
rural roads; dust from animal pens, field work, harvest and gravel
roads; odor from animal confinement, silage, and manure; smoke
from ditch burning; flies and mosquitoes; hunting and trapping

identified in a Wildlife Report.
2. Wildlife Report.
a. The Wildlife Report shall consist of narrative and maps necessary to identify critical
habitat areas and characteristics, big game winter ranges, and big game migration
corridors. Maps shall consist of Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s most recent habitat
mapping of the area.
b. The Wildlife Report shall describe proposed measures for the protection of wildlife,
habitat, and migration corridors, which shall first seek to avoid impacts, then to
minimize impacts, then to mitigate impacts. The Wildlife Report shall demonstrate
compliance with the following standards:
1.1.1.a.1.1) Elements of habitat or range that are interdependent shall not be separated in ways that
materially compromise the overall habitat or range.
1.1.1.a.1.2) Protected areas of big game migration corridors and big game winter ranges shall provide a
continuous connection to off-site big game migration corridors and big game winter ranges, such
that large-scale regional wildlife movements are not impeded by the proposed development of the
subject property.

impacts.
E. Wetlands
1. Generally. If there is evidence that wetlands are present on a subject property, such
resources shall be identified in wetlands delineation and a functional assessment report
shall be provided.
2. Exception. The Director may waive the report requirement if it is demonstrated that the
proposed development is sufficiently distant from the wetlands that the requirements of
Delta County Land Use Code Page
103
Subsection (3), below, will be met, and impacts from the development (e.g., from storm
water runoff) on the wetlands are unlikely to be material.
3. Development in Proximity of Wetlands. Development shall not occur within delineated
wetlands and within one hundred (100) feet of the boundary of delineated wetlands, unless:
a. The proposed development within said area enhances the functional value (or
protects and maintains a high functional value) of the wetlands (e.g., wetlands
enhancement, remediation, management, or restoration) according to plans
approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other governmental authorities
with jurisdiction; or
b. The wetlands delineation and functional assessment report indicate that
development closer to the wetlands will not materially degrade the quality of the
wetlands nor materially increase the risk of damage to the wetlands.

c. Ditches (even if lined or piped) may seep, and easements for such seepage may be
expressed (e.g., by deed) or implied (e.g., created by prescription). Seepage may
result in high water tables.
2. Crossings and Modifications within Ditch Right-of-Way.
a. Development shall not involve crossings of or modifications to ditch Right-of-Way
(below the surface, on the surface, or above the surface), unless:
1.1.1.a.1.1) The affected ditch company consents to such crossing or modification in writing, upon such
terms as may be agreed between the applicant and the ditch company.
1.1.1.a.1.2) If the Right-of-Way is an easement (and not a fee-simple ownership interest of the ditch
company) a court authorizes the crossing by final, non-appealable order finding that the crossing or
modification does not significantly lessen the utility of the easement, increase the burdens on the
owner of the easement, or frustrate the purpose for which the easement was created.
1.1.1.a.1.3) If a crossing agreement is to be assigned to the County or another governmental entity (e.g.,
the Colorado Department of Transportation), the applicant shall obtain approval of the anticipated
assignee of the crossing agreement (as applicable) as to the form of the agreement and the
conditions of assignment (if any) prior to approval of the application.
3. Construction Dewatering and Drainage Systems.
a. No drainage system shall direct storm water runoff into an irrigation ditch or
reservoir without the written consent of the affected ditch company.
b. All construction dewatering activities and drainage systems (either surface or
subsurface) that are located within one hundred (100) feet of a ditch or reservoir
bank shall be evaluated at the applicant’s expense by a qualified Engineer with
regard to their potential impacts on seepage into or out of the ditch or reservoir. If
such activities or systems are determined to create a material risk of such seepage,
then the applicant shall:
1.1.1.a.1.1) Propose appropriate and durable mitigation measures to prevent such seepage; or
1.1.1.a.1.2) Enter into an agreement with the ditch company to address such seepage impacts on terms
that are mutually acceptable to the applicant and the ditch company.
4. County Approval Conditions.
a. Where a subject property is bounded by or crossed by an irrigation ditch Right-ofWay or other irrigation infrastructure, the boundaries of the ditch Right-of-Way or
other irrigation infrastructure shall be shown on the approved plans and plat
documents, as applicable.
b. Delineated ditch easements shall be of sufficient width to allow for access and
maintenance (both routine and extraordinary including removal and deposit of
materials for cleaning purposes), including staging areas and dimensions sufficient
to accommodate over swing of construction machinery, as necessary or appropriate.
In making the determination of sufficiency, the County shall consider input from the
affected ditch company or ditch users.

G. Scenic Impacts
1. Generally. This applies to a subject property that is located within one-quarter (¼) mile
from the Right-of-Way of a scenic byway.
2. Report Required. A Scenic Impacts Report shall contain the following information:
a. A graphic illustration of the impact of the proposed development on the views from
designated scenic byways;
b. An illustration of ground elevations, existing buildings and structures, and
vegetative cover before development (the “pre-development condition”), in planview and elevation view, taking into account the elevation of the road and the
distance to the scenic resource;
c. An illustration of the proposed development (the “post-development condition”) in
plan-view, and in elevation view from the same vantage points that were used to
illustrate the pre-development condition;
d. A narrative that describes the measures that are proposed in order to mitigate the
impact of the proposed development on the scenic resource.
3. Implementation of Mitigation Requirements.
a. The scenic impact of a proposed development shall not, by itself, be a reason for
denying an application for development approval. However, the County may
require mitigation measures such as alternative setbacks, building placement,
building design, and landscaping techniques.
b. The County may approve modifications to the development standards of this Code
in order to improve the mitigation of the impacts of development on scenic
resources, provided that such modifications do not materially impact public safety.
Section 6. Geologic and Wildfire Hazards
A. Purpose and Application of Section
1. Purpose of Section. The purpose of this Section is to ensure that development occurs with
due regard to geologic and wildfire hazards, such that it does not exacerbate hazards for
adjacent and nearby land uses or create a danger to public health and safety.
B. Disclaimer
The degree of hazard protection intended to be provided by this Section is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. This
regulation does not imply that the areas outside of established hazard boundaries or uses
permitted within these boundaries will be totally free from damage caused by these hazards. This
regulation shall not create any liability on the part of, or cause an action against, the County, the
Board of County Commissioners, or any officer or employee or official (elected or appointed)
thereof for damages that may result from reliance upon the regulations set out in this Section.
C. Designation of Hazard Areas
1. Official Hazard Area Maps. Maps and documentation regarding the general location of
geologic and wildfire hazard areas (“ OFFICIAL HAZARD AREA MAPS”) are on file at the
Department.
2. Wildfire Hazard Areas. Wildfire hazard areas are identified on maps prepared by the
Colorado Forest Service, and located within the DELTA COUNTY LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN
 (LHMP) and the COMMUNITY WILDFIRE PROTECTION PLAN (CWPP) (www.councilcowildfire.org).
3. Steep Slopes. Steep slopes are those areas on a subject property with an average grade of
30 twenty-five percent or more (25%+). Steep slopes shall be identified using U.S.
Geological Survey topographic maps, site-specific surveys, or other techniques that are
approved by the Director.
4. Areas of Special Flood Hazard. Areas of special flood hazard shall be mapped according to
their boundaries as shown on the most recent official maps in effect available from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”).
5. Abandoned Mines. Abandoned mines are identified on maps promulgated by the Colorado
Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety in conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service.
6. Abandoned Oil and Gas Wells. Abandoned oil and gas wells shall be identified using
records from Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and physical inspection of the
subject property.
7. Site-Specific Delineation. The maps described in Subsection (1), above, define only
approximate boundaries of hazard areas. The maps serve primarily as notice that geologic
and/or wildfire and/or slope hazards are known to exist on or near a subject property, such
that further analysis may be necessary. Precise boundary delineations require site-specific
evaluation by qualified professionals.
D. Geologic Hazard Mitigation
1. Generally. This is not intended to categorically preempt all future development. The
mitigation that may be required by this shall be proportionate to the nature, severity,
probability, and frequency of the hazard and the nature and intensity of the proposed land
use.
2. Engineering Study.
a. Scope of Study. If a subject property is known or reasonably suspected to be located
in a geologic hazard area or wildfire hazard area, then the Director may require the
applicant to provide a site-specific engineering study to:
1.1.1.a.1.1) Delineate the hazard;
1.1.1.a.1.2) Define its degree of severity;
1.1.1.a.1.3) Determine its frequency/probability of recurrence;
1.1.1.a.1.4) Evaluate the compatibility of the proposed land use;
Delta County Land Use Code Page
107
1.1.1.a.1.5) Propose appropriate mitigation measures to reduce risks to people, property, and natural
resources; and
1.1.1.a.1.6) Propose ongoing operations and maintenance programs to ensure that the mitigation
measures function properly.
b. Qualifications of Investigator. All reports and studies required by this shall be
prepared by a “Professional Geologist” (as defined by C.R.S. § 34-1-01, as amended)
as to geologic investigations; or a registered “Professional Engineer” (as defined by
C.R.S. § 12-25-102, as amended) as to engineering studies, each retained by, under
the direction of, and at the expense of the owner or applicant. For the purposes of
this, the Geologist or Engineer is referred to as the “investigator”.
c. Extent of Investigation. The extent of the site-specific investigation required shall be
determined by the investigator; however, the investigation shall be of sufficient
thoroughness and accuracy to allow such expert to certify to one of the following:
1.1.1.a.1.1) The subject property can be developed for the specific development that is proposed,
without corrective engineering, engineered construction, or other mitigation or alterations; or
1.1.1.a.1.2) The subject property is a geologically sensitive area, but the specific development that is
proposed:
1.1.1.a.1.2.a) Can be constructed with corrective engineering, engineered construction, or other
mitigation or alterations that reduce the risks to the occupants of the development such that they
are reasonable; and
1.1.1.a.1.2.b) Will not increase the hazard to other property or structures or to public buildings,
Rights-of-Way, roads, easements, utilities or facilities, or other properties of any kind.
1.1.1.a.1.3) The subject property is a geologically sensitive area on which the specific proposed
development is not appropriate because there are no mitigation techniques that could reduce the
risks created by the geologic hazard to a reasonable level with respect to:
1.1.1.a.1.3.a) Occupants, improvements, and personal property on the subject property; and
1.1.1.a.1.3.b) Other property or structures, public buildings, Rights-of-Way, roads, easements,
utilities, or facilities of any kind that are currently affected by the hazard or that would likely be
affected by the hazard if the proposed development occurred.
d. Effect of Study.
1.1.1.a.1.1) No Hazard. If the investigator finds that the subject property does not contain and is not
affected by geologic hazards, and therefore can be developed as proposed without corrective
engineering, engineered construction, or other mitigation or alterations, then the proposed
development may be approved without conditions relating to the mitigation of geologic hazards.
1.1.1.a.1.2) Avoidance of Hazard. If the investigator finds that the subject property contains or is
affected by a geologic hazard, but the proposed location of the proposed development avoids the
geologic hazard such that it can be developed as proposed without corrective engineering, or
engineered construction, or other mitigation or alterations, the proposed development may be
approved with conditions restricting the location of the proposed development on the subject
property.
1.1.1.a.1.3) Mitigation of Hazard. If the investigator finds that the subject property contains or is
affected by a geologic hazard, but that corrective engineering, engineered construction, or other
mitigation or alterations can be implemented to reduce the risk to the public health, public safety,
or public or private property to a reasonable level, and such mitigation does not increase the
hazard to other property or structures, or to public buildings, roads, Rights-of-Way, easements,
utilities, or facilities, approval of the proposed development shall be conditioned upon approval of
plans for corrective engineering and engineered construction or other mitigation or alterations to
acceptably reduce the risks.
1.1.1.a.1.4) No Practical Mitigation Technique. If the conclusion of the investigator is that the subject
property cannot be developed as proposed because the danger posed by the geologic hazard cannot
practically be reduced or mitigated to a reasonable level, such mitigation is otherwise not feasible,
or the proposed development would exacerbate a hazard, the application for development approval
shall be denied. Such denial shall not operate to limit applications for alternative uses for which a
feasible mitigation plan may be developed.
3. Techniques. Mitigation techniques shall be consistent with the purposes of this Code.
Examples of mitigation techniques which may be acceptable include:
a. Retaining walls, fill, rock bolting, or pilings;
b. Diversion, channeling, damming, or barriers;
c. Excavation of unstable areas, bridging of weak zones, or proper distribution of
loading; or
d. Improvement of surface and subsurface drainage.
4. Notice Requirements. In order to provide reasonable notice of the presence of geologically
sensitive lands in or affecting a proposed development, the following notices shall be
provided for all new development in geologically sensitive lands:
a. All Final Plats that are recorded after the effective date of this Code shall identify
and designate each tract, lot, and block, or portions thereof, located within any
geologically sensitive area, together with appropriate specific hazard designations.
b. All other plans submitted after the effective date of this Code shall delineate
geologically sensitive areas and identify the nature of the hazards.
5. Existing Uses Continued; Exceptions. Existing use of land, structures, or property that
does not conform to this may be continued; except that no approval shall be granted for the
expansion, alteration, or addition to existing buildings or structures in geologically sensitive
areas unless all of the requirements of this are met.
E. Wildfire Hazard Mitigation
1. Generally. The Wildland-Urban Interface ("WUI") is a geographical area where structures
and other human development meets or intermingles with wildland or vegetative fuels. The
WUI creates a potentially dangerous situation for flames or embers from a wildland fire to
Delta County Land Use Code Page
109
come in contact with buildings and structures. The purpose of this is to provide a means to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare by establishing standards for development
within a WUI area in order to:
a. Reduce threats to life safety, property, and resources by improving development
and construction standards, access to and defensibility of developments, homes, and
other property in WUI areas;
b. Minimize the potential of spreading fire from wildland areas to buildings or
structures and from building or structure fires to wildland areas;
c. Identify the appropriate use of cul-de-sacs, hammerhead turnarounds, and turnouts
on streets and roads providing legal and physical access to subdivisions with the
intent to provide better emergency access to remote areas; and
d. Require homeowners and neighborhoods to plan, create, and maintain defensible
space that utilizes fire resistant construction and landscaping.
2. Compliance with NFPA 1144. Proposed development that is located in the WUI shall
provide and implement a Wildfire Hazard Mitigation Plan. The Wildfire Hazard Mitigation
Plan shall address measures such as clear- space around structures, use of fire- resistant
materials in construction, access to fire hydrants or other water sources, and consideration
of secondary emergency access.
F. Steep Slopes
1. Generally. Steep slopes are divided into two (2) groups:
a. “Mmoderately Ssteep” slopes of fifteen-percent (15%) to twenty-five percent (25%),
(inclusive), and
b. “Vvery Ssteep” slopes greater than twenty-five percent (25%).
2. Minimization of Cut and Fill. Cut and fill of steep slopes shall be minimized in one (1) or
more of the following ways:
a. Generally, sites shall be re-graded as a stable slope that is comparable to existing
natural conditions.
b. Large-scale grade changes (where such changes are necessary) shall be divided into
a series of benches and/or terraces. Parking areas that are planned for steep slopes
shall be located on terraces that are designed to follow site contours. Benches and
terraces shall be arranged so that they are not located in or immediately uphill or
downhill from areas of potentially unstable slopes or known landslide areas, unless
such areas are stabilized.
c. Roads and driveways shall be designed to minimize cuts and fills in a manner that is
consistent with safe geometric design and the long-term stability and durability of
the road or driveway, while:
1.1.1.a.1.1) Minimizing the alteration of the physical and visual character of the hillside (e.g., large
notches in ridgelines should be avoided); and
1.1.1.a.1.2) Retaining natural landforms by utilizing gentle horizontal and vertical curves in alignments
(i.e., alignments on the hillside should be neither wider nor straighter than necessary).
d. Where feasible, building foundations shall be stepped to follow significant existing
contours, and the major axes of buildings shall run parallel to existing contours.
3. Geologic and Soils Report. A geologic and soils report is required prior to development
upon very steep slopes. See Chapter 5, Section 2(B), Geologic and Soils Report.
G. Abandoned Mines and Quarries
1. Generally. Abandoned mines and quarries involve significant hazards, potentially
including, but not limited to, the presence of toxic gasses, chemicals, and metals,; unstable
soils and structures,; and radioactive materials, in and around the mines or quarries.
Abandoned mines or quarries may be a source of air and water pollution in areas that are
distant from the mines or quarries.
2. Evaluation. If there is evidence that the subject property was impacted by past mining
activities, the subject property shall be evaluated pursuant to the methodologies set out in
the current version of “Best Practices in Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation,” promulgated
by the Colorado Division of Minerals and Geology.
3. Reporting and Inspection. If an abandoned mine or quarry is located, it shall be reported
to the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety, and an inspection by the
Division shall be requested.
4. Closure and Lateral Support. Prior to development of the subject property, the applicant
shall obtain approval of a closure plan, remediation plan, and/or lateral support plan, as
appropriate, and implement such plan to the extent necessary to allow for safe development
of the subject property. The County may allow development to proceed prior to full
implementation of the plans if the location of the abandoned mine or quarry is secured and
the development area is sufficiently distant from the abandoned mine or quarry that the
risks to the development from the abandoned mine or quarry are minimal.
H. Abandoned (“Orphaned”) Oil and Gas Wells
1. Generally. Abandoned wells shall be plugged, remediated, and reclaimed, as appropriate,
according to state requirements, prior to development.
2. Exceptions. The County may allow development to proceed prior to plugging, remediation,
and reclamation if:
a. The location of the abandoned well is secured; and
b. The development area is sufficiently distant from the abandoned well that the risks
to the development from the abandoned well are minimal.
I. Floodplain/Floodway (Special Flood Hazard Area)
1. Generally. If there is evidence that a floodway or floodplain is present on a subject
property, such resources shall be mapped on the Site Plan or Plat. Development should
consider any proposed map changes in determining hazards.
Delta County Land Use Code Page
111
2. Exception. The Floodplain Administrator may waive this requirement if it is demonstrated
that the proposed development is sufficiently distant from the floodway or floodplain and
impacts from the development (e.g., increased flood risk on site or downstream) would be
unlikely.
3. Development in Floodplain or Floodway. Development shall not occur within a floodway
unless approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other governmental authorities
with jurisdiction. Development within a Floodplain requires approval by Delta County’s
Floodplain Administrator (See Appendix; Floodplain Regulations).
Section 7. Environmental Quality
A. Purpose and Application of Section
1. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish minimum standards for maintaining
environmental quality within the County. These standards apply to the planning, design,
and operation of land uses in the County.
2. Right-to-Farm. The Right-to-Farm, as described and protected by C.R.S. §§ 35-3.5-101, et
seq. shall not be compromised by this Section. Uses in the agriculture land use category
shall not be found in violation of this Section to the extent that they employ methods or
practices that are commonly or reasonably associated with agricultural production.
B. Stormwater Management, Grading, Erosion, and Sediment Control
1. Generally. Colorado follows the modified civil law rule that the owner of upstream
property possesses a natural easement on land downstream for drainage of surface water
flowing in its natural course. Natural drainage conditions may be altered by the owner of
the upstream land, provided that the water in the post-development condition is not sent
down in a manner or quantity to do more harm to the downstream land prior to
development. Development proposals that would result in drainage volumes or patterns
that would likely violate the modified civil law rule will not be approved unless the
applicant obtains appropriate approvals and/or easements from the affected property
owner(s).
2. Stormwater Management Plans. All Site Plans associated with Limited and Conditional
Uses shall be accompanied by a Stormwater Management Plan, sealed by a Professional
Engineer that certifies compliance with the requirements of Subsection (1), above.
3. State Permits. A Colorado Discharge Permit System (“CDPS”) permit shall be obtained if
required by state law.
C. Noise
1. Generally. Noise that is generated by development shall not exceed the thresholds set out
in C.R.S. § 25-12-103, Maximum Permissible Noise Levels, except as provided in C.R.S. § 25-
12-109, Exception - Sport Shooting Ranges - Legislative Declaration – Definitions, or any
other specific exceptions created by the State of Colorado after the effective date of this
Code.
2. Development Design. Proposed development shall be designed to ensure that noise does
not exceed the statutory limits. Where design is not sufficient to mitigate noise impacts, the
applicant shall submit a Noise Mitigation Plan that includes operational limitations to
mitigate the noise impacts. Adherence to the Noise Mitigation Plan shall be a condition of
approval.
D. Odor Management
1. Generally. An Odor Management Plan is required for intensive agriculture uses (See
Chapter 2, Section 45), and may be required for other land uses that tend to generate
offensive or noxious odors. Odor Management Plans shall meet the minimum requirements
of this, and shall achieve compliance with 5 CCR 1001-4, Part A or Part B, as appropriate.
2. Odor Management Plans for other uses (not intensive agriculture) shall identify:
1.1.1.a.a. The location of odor-emitting activities or procedures;
1.1.1.a.b. The source or sources of the odors;
1.1.1.a.c. The timing of odor-emitting activities;
1.1.1.a.d. The controls (e.g., administrative, structural, chemical, or
mechanical) that will be used to mitigate odor impacts; and
1.1.1.a.e. The maintenance program that will be followed to ensure the
effectiveness of the proposed controls.
3. Proposed odor controls shall be based on best available control technologies.
4. Odor Management Plans shall also provide for complaint tracking. Complaint records shall
be provided to the County within three business days after request by the Director.
E. Pest Management
1. Generally. Pest Management Plans shall be required as set out in this Code, and for
proposed land uses that the Director finds may have a heightened risk of problematic pest
infestations.
2. Contents of Pest Management Plans. Pest Management Plans shall identify:
a. The types of pests that may be associated with the proposed land use at a level that
requires management;
b. The methods, techniques, barriers, biological agents, or chemical agents that will be
used to control the identified pests (the “ PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM”), the anticipated
timing of application of chemical or biological agents, and the method of storage of
chemical or biological agents; and
c. The controls that will be used to minimize the impacts of the Pest Management
Planrogram on nearby property, waterbodies (including but not limited to irrigation
ditches and reservoirs), livestock operations, and environmentally sensitive lands.
Delta County Land Use Code Page
113
F. Dust Control
1. Generally. Dust Ccontrol Plans are required for industrial uses that generate dust, and
for intensive agriculture uses (See Chapter 2 Section 45). Dust Ccontrol Plans may also
be required for roads, driveways, parking areas, and outdoor storage or processing
areas that are not constructed with a dust-free hard surface.
2. Industrial and Extraction Uses.
a. Industrial and extraction uses that generate dust shall submit a Dust Control
Plan to accompany the proposed sketch plan or site plan. The Dust Control Plan shall
include all available practical methods that are technologically feasible and
economically reasonable and that will reduce, prevent, and control fugitive dust into
the atmosphere.
b. For those materials, equipment, services or other resources (such as water
for abatement and control purposes), which are likely to be scarce at any given time,
an alternative control method must be included in the Dust Control Plan.
c. Where the proposed land use is accessed by an unpaved road or access
easement, the County may require that the Dust Control Plan provide for mitigation
of dust along the unpaved road or access easement.
3. Other Uses or Improvements. Dust Ccontrol Plans may be required for subdivision
roads, private driveways, parking areas, and outdoor storage or processing areas, in
order to minimize adverse impacts to livestock, crops, and public health.
G. Weed Control
1. Generally. As mandated by the Colorado Noxious Weed Act (C.R.S. § 35-5.5-101, et seq.), all
persons shall eliminate, contain, or suppress (as appropriate) noxious weeds on their
property if:
a. Such weeds are a threat to neighboring landowners or natural ecosystems; or
b. Such control is required by C.R.S. § 35-5.5-101, et seq. or 8 CCR § 1206-2, Rules
Pertaining to the Administration and Enforcement of the Colorado Noxious Weed
Act.
c. Weed control programs shall be integrated in approach (using all available prudent
technologies to achieve weed control), to the extent required by 8 CCR § 1206-2.
2. Weed Control Plans. The County may condition approval of subdivisions, Limited Uses,
and Conditional Uses (or amendments thereto) upon approval of a Weed Control Plan plan
for the control of the noxious weeds identified by the State or Federal government or
designated undesirable by the Board of County Commissioners. The Weed Control Plan plan
shall include the interim time period during which the land is converted from its current
use to its proposed use.
3. Plat Note. All Final Plats shall contain the following statement: a note that owners are
responsible for weed control on their properties. See Chapter 12, Section 5(I).
H. Exterior Lighting
1. Generally. Outdoor lights shall be hooded or shielded (cut-off) so as to not cast light or
glare onto adjacent property, or upwards in a manner that contributes to sky glow that
dilutes the night sky.
2. Required Plat Note. All Final Plats shall contain the following statement: a note that
restricts lighting impacts. See Chapter 12, Section 5(I).
 I. Domestic Animal Control
1. Generally. Dogs and other domestic animals that are not used to assist with the herding or
care of livestock are not permitted to interfere with livestock, the care of livestock on
agricultural lands, or with wildlife that is present on sensitive lands. Domestic animals must
be controlled by kenneling, leash, fencing, or other physical or voice control constraints.
2. Covenants. The County may require that subdivisions include covenants that provide that
any expense of enforcement of this domestic animal control restrictions by the County shall
be at the expense of the responsible association or the individual.
J. Operational Hazard Mitigation and Risk Management
1. Generally. An Operational Hazard Mitigation and Risk Management Plan is required for
uses as specifically identified in this Code and for uses that the Director determines may
involve substantial risks or hazards to nearby property owners, natural resources
(including wildlife and sensitive lands), or water supplies due to the nature of the
operations or materials likely to be used, stored, or disposed of on the subject property.
2. When Required. For the uses that require Operational Hazard Mitigation and Risk
Management Plans, such plans shall be submitted with sketch plans or site plans.
3. Updates. The Operational Hazard Mitigation and Risk Management Plans shall be updated
on a bi-annual basis, or within ten (10) working days as conditions change (responsible
field personnel change, ownership changes, etc.).
4. Contents. The Operational Hazard Mitigation and Risk Management Plan shall, at a
minimum, consist of the following information:
a. Name, address and phone number, including twenty-four (24) hour emergency
numbers for at least two (2) persons responsible for emergency field operations.

provided to first responders and dispatch.
d. Project-specific Emergency Response Plans are required for any mining or oil and gas
extraction project that involves drilling or penetrating through known zones of
hydrogen sulfide gas.
5. Confidentiality. To the extent allowed by law, the Operational Hazard Mitigation and Risk
Management Plan shall be held confidentially by the entities to which they are provided,
and shall only be disclosed in the event of an emergency.
K. Truck Routing Plans
1. Generally. A Truck Routing Plan is required for uses as specifically identified in this Code
and for uses that the Director determines will involve the use of semi-trailers, dump trucks,
trash hauling trucks, or comparable heavy trucks at a frequency that is likely to be
disruptive to nearby property owners or potentially damaging to roads.
2. When Required. For the uses that require a Truck Routing Plan, such Plan shall be
submitted with sketch plans or a site plans. Any Plan that includes a route using roads
under authority of another agency shall be referred for their review (municipality, State,
Federal).
3. Updates. Truck Routing Plans shall be updated when:

Chapter 5. PUBLIC FACILITIES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND
SERVICES
Section 1. Traffic Impacts
A. Purpose and Application of Section
1. Purpose of Section. The purpose of this Section is to ensure that the traffic impacts of
proposed development and subdivision are evaluated and that the impacts of such
development on the County transportation system are offset by public improvements.
2. Application of Section. The requirements of this Section apply to sketch plans or Site Plans
associated with Limited or Conditional Uses, and Preliminary Plats (or Final Plats, where no
Preliminary Plat is required prior to Final Plat approval), and also to additional residences,
communal living, and seasonal farmworker housing if such accessory residential uses result
in five or more (5+) dwelling units on a single lot. When a traffic impact study is required,
the study shall be completed by a Colorado registered Professional Engineer.
Uses that are Allowed Uses as-of-right are not subject to the requirements of this Section.
The Director may waive requirement of a Traffic Impact Study if it is determined that the
increase would be de minimis.
3. Scope of Study.
a. A Level I Traffic Impact Study is required for all application types listed in su (2),
above.when a project is determined to impact traffic on a public road.
b. Where a Level I Ttraffic Impact Sstudy indicates that a proposed development or
subdivision will impact more than twenty-percent (20%) of a road’s capacity, a
Level II traffic study shall be required.
c. Where a Level II Traffic Impact Study indicates that improvements to the existing
road network are necessary to address the traffic impacts of a proposed
development or subdivision, a Level III Traffic Impact Study shall be required.
B. Traffic Impact Study Contents
1. Generally. The contents and extent of a Traffic Impact Study depend on the location and
size of the proposed development and the conditions prevailing in the surrounding area.
The permit applicant should contact County Planning to determine the appropriate level of
traffic evaluation and the specific requirements for each individual application. Traffic
Iimpact Sstudies shall include, at a minimum, the information required by this Table 5.a,
Traffic Impact Study Scope, based on the level of study required. Trip Generation
Calculations per the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation document (latest
version)
Selected items from Table 5.a (below) may be excluded if the Director determines that it is
not applicable to the situation and exclusion is specifically authorized by the issuing
authority. The contents and extent of a Traffic Impact Study depend on the location and size

of the proposed development and the conditions prevailing in the surrounding area. Larger
developments proposed in congested areas obviously require more extensive traffic
analysis, whereas smaller sites may only require a minimal analysis of traffic on site and at
immediately adjacent intersections.
In determining how large a study area to include, a general guideline is to carry the analysis
out at least as far as those areas where newly generated site traffic represents five-percent
(5%) or more of roadway’s peak hour capacity. Where site generated traffic will be less than
five-percent (5%) of the roadway capacity, the intersections adjacent to the site should, at a
minimum, be analyzed. The study area boundaries may also be influenced by impacts other
than pure capacity relationships such as neighborhood short cuts, traffic noise and hours of
operation.

Section 2. Soils Suitability and Drainage Analysis
A. Purpose and Application of Section
1. Purpose of Section. The purpose of this Section is to establish minimum requirements for
soils and drainage reports, to ensure that new development is constructed on suitable soils,
that natural geologic hazards are avoided or mitigated where possible, and that drainage is
designed in a manner that is consistent with State law.
2. Application of Section. Each section of this Section sets out the types of applications to
which the Section applies.
B. Geologic and Soils Report
1. Generally. Geologic and Soils Reports are required for site plans associated with Limited or
Conditional Uses, and Preliminary Plats (or Final Plats, where no Preliminary Plat is
required prior to Final Plat approval). Where other application types involve a mandatory
dedication of Right-of-Way (e.g., to mitigate a traffic impact), the County may require a
Geologic and Soils Report for the area of land to be dedicated as Right-of-Way.
2. Site Characteristics. The Geologic and Soils Report shall include the observations of a site
visit by a qualified Engineer regarding the site characteristics outlined in Colorado
Geological Survey, SP-06 GUIDELINES AND CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFICATION AND LAND-USE CONTROLS OF
 GEOLOGIC HAZARD AND MINERAL RESOURCE AREAS. The Report shall address ground subsidence,
expansive soil, and rock. The Report shall also address the following as may be applicable
to the subject property or its immediate environsment:
a. Avalanche
b. Landslide
c. Rockfall
d. Radioactivity
e. Mudflow
f. Debris fan
g. Unstable and potentially unstable slopes
h. Seismic effects
3. Soils Suitability. The Report shall assess the suitability of the soils for:
a. Building foundations and structures;
b. Infrastructure;
c. Proposed individual sewage disposalonsite wastewater treatment systems,
including the cumulative impact of all proposed ISDS OWTS on the subject property;
and
d. Implementation of the proposed Drainage Plan.
4. Irrigation Infrastructure. The Report shall assess the impacts of proposed excavation and
development on irrigation infrastructure within one hundred (100) feet of the limits of
construction, including impacts on the stability of ditch banks and seepage into or out of
irrigation ditches.
C. Drainage Report
1. Generally. A Drainage Report consists of two parts: a drainage study and a drainage and
erosion control plan. Drainage Reports are required for site plans associated with Limited
or Conditional uses and Preliminary Plats (or Final Plats, where no Preliminary Plat is
required prior to Final Plat approval). Drainage Reports shall demonstrate compliance with
Chapter 4, Section 7(B), Stormwater Management, Grading, Erosion, and Sediment Control,
and any applicable State or Federal standards for grading, erosion, and sediment control.
2. Drainage Study. The Drainage Study is intended to analyze the drainage characteristics of
the subject property under both the existing condition (pre-development) and proposed
condition (post-development). Its principal purpose is to evaluate the drainage impacts of
proposed development on downstream properties. The Drainage Study includes:
a. Identification of the major drainage basin, sub basins, and drainageways; and
b. Calculation of pre-development and post-development stormwater discharge rates
for the five (5) year and one hundred (100) year storm events;
c. An evaluation of the impacts of proposed development on adjacent and downstream
properties; and
d. Proposed mitigation measures and temporary, permanent, structural, and nonstructural best management practices (“BMPs”), as appropriate, to ensure that
stormwater runoff from the post-development condition does not affect adjacent or
downstream properties in a manner or quantity that does more harm than the predevelopment condition. The description of BMPs shall include information
regarding the use, design, installation, maintenance, and removal of the BMP.
3. Drainage and Erosion Control Plan. The Drainage and Erosion Control Plan details the
locations and specifications of the mitigation measures and best management practices that
are detailed in the Drainage Study. The Drainage and Erosion Control Plan includes:
Delta County Land Use Code Page

accessory residential uses result in two or more dwelling units on a single lot.
2. Exceptions.
a. The Director can waive this requirement if it is determined that pProof of adequacy
of water supply is not required if was previously provided during the review for a
prior approval related to the same proposed development (e.g., if proof of adequacy
was provided for a Preliminary Plat, and subsequently a Final Plat application is
filed that is consistent with the Preliminary Plat, additional proof of adequacy is not
required).
b. HoweverEven if prior proof has been provided previously, additional proof of
adequacy of water supply may be required if the Director determines that:
1.1.1.a.1.1) The County determines that Tthe proposed development has changed since the prior
determination in a manner that will require additional water supply or changed water supply
parameters (e.g., a subdivision is approved for residential development, and then a Conditional Use
Permit is requested for a non-residential use); or
1.1.1.a.1.2) The County determines that tThe water supply that was previously evaluated has materially
changed since the prior determination of adequacy (e.g., water taps that were previously allocated
have expired).
3. Scope of Evidence.
a. Adequate evidence shall be provided that a water supply meets the minimum
Colorado Primary Drinking Water Regulations and that is sufficient in terms of
quality, quantity, and dependability. Evidence that is sufficient in terms of quality,
quantity, and dependability will be available to ensure an adequate supply of water

of extending service to that area;
1.1.1.a.1.5) Evidence concerning the potability of the proposed water supply for the subdivision.
4. LimitationsCisterns.
a. Cisterns shall not be considered an adequate water supply for residential usesnew
development where the water is hauled; however,. a cistern may be allowed when
the following applies:
a.1)The property is located within the service area of a purveyor and the purveyor agrees to allow a
cistern; or
a.2)There is no other water source available; and
a.3)Development consists of a maximum of one (1) dwelling unit and one (1) ADU.
b. Cisterns may be allowed where there is a permitted, on-site water source (e.g., well
or spring).
Delta County Land Use Code Page

Chapter 7. STANDARDIZED APPLICATION REVIEW PROCESS
Section 1. Application Submittal Requirements
A. Development Application
a.i.1. Generally. Any development occurring on a parcel of land in the
unincorporated area of Delta County will require the completion of a Development
Application, which outlines the type, and order, of individual permits/approvals that must
be obtained. A Development Application procedure includes, but is not limited to (See
Chapter 8; Review Processes):
a.i.1.a. Site Plan Review;
a.i.1.b. Access Permit;
a.i.1.c. Address Permit; and
a.i.1.d. Onsite Wastewater Treatment System (OWTS) Permit (e.g., septic,
composting, incinerator).
Upon completion of an initial Site Plan Review, County Permits must be approved in the
order above, each before the next permit will be issued. An Applicant may apply for any or
all of the above Permits depending on the applicant’s needs; however, proof of approved
Permits must be provided in order to obtain the next Permit.
a.i.2. Site Plan Review. Concept plans can be submitted with the Development
Application. The purpose of the Site Plan Review is to ensure compliance with the
permitting process and standards as set forth in this Code. For land uses that only require
Site Plan Review, development permits may be issued on after a Site Plan showing the
proposed development has been approved and illustrates, at a minimum:
a.i.2.a. Perimeter boundary with dimensions;
a.i.2.b. Total acreage;
a.i.2.c. North Arrow;
a.i.2.d. Location and number of all structures (existing and proposed);
a.i.2.e. Distance to the property boundary of all structures (existing and
proposed);
a.i.2.f. Location and dimensions of all easements;
a.i.2.g. Location of any springs, wells, streams, ditches, rivers or waterways;
a.i.2.h. Name and location of all roads adjoining the property with the
location of all access (existing and proposed);
a.i.2.i. Distance between any access (existing and proposed) including
those on neighboring properties and the distance to the nearest intersection;
a.i.2.j. Location of all septic systems (existing and proposed); and
a.i.2.k. Building Envelopes (existing and proposed).
a.i.3. Access Permit. A County Access Permit is required for any entrance onto a
County road. Access onto a State highway requires proof of a highway access permit that
allows the proposed use (issued by CDOT). Access within the unincorporated County area
(public or private) is subject to DELTA COUNTY ROADWAY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS. A
Notice to Proceed will be issued if the County Engineer determines that the location of the
proposed access compiles with County requirements and safety standards. An Access
Permit is not final until the County Engineer approves that the access has been constructed
to County standards.
a.i.4. Assign Address. An address is required for all habitable structures
(residential and commercial) for emergency services and utilities (See DELTA COUNTY ADDRESS
 REGULATIONS). Addresses are assigned by the location of the access prior to providing service
to a parcel. Addresses are assigned by the location of an access to a parcel. Therefore, the
access must be constructed and approved by the County Engineer before an address is
assigned by County GIS.
 DELTA COUNTY ADDRESS REGULATIONS establish standards for when and how an access will be
named. Existing structures addressed off that access will be addressed and/or readdressed
accordingly. For new development, an application may be required for establishing a new
named road, See Chapter 4, Section 1(F).
a.i.5. Septic. An Onsite Wastewater Treatment System (OWTS) Permit is
required for every structure on a parcel with a restroom or sewer drain. Access and
address must be completed and approved prior to the issuance of an OWTS Permit by the
Health Department.
a.i.6. Informal Consultation. Individuals may schedule an informal meeting to
discuss potential plans prior to submitting an application and/or pre-application at the
discretion of the Director.

1.1.1.a.1.1) Alternative means have been implemented to achieve a comparable or better level of
resource protection (e.g., conservation easements, development agreements, or other comparable
mechanisms for resource protection); or
1.1.1.a.1.2) The policy is outweighed by a community interest that is served by approval of the
rezoning.
3. Plan Consistency and Public Facilities
All applications for rezoning shall meet the following criteria:
a. The proposed zoning district, as applied to the subject property, is consistent with
its land use designation in the DELTA COUNTY MASTER PLAN or an amendment to the
Delta County Land Use Code Page
161
 DELTA COUNTY MASTER PLAN prior to (or concurrently with) the approval of the
rezoning application; and
b. Adequate public facilities are available to serve development in the proposed zoning
district; or the proposed zoning district would limit demands upon public facilities
more than the existing zoning district; or reasonable assurances are provided that
adequate public facilities will be made available to serve new development by the
time the new development places demands on the facilities.
4. Additional Findings. The Board of County Commissioners may approve an application for
rezoning upon a determination that at least one (1) of the following three (3) criteria has
been met.
a. Alternative #1: Plan Implementation. The proposed zoning district is more
appropriate than the existing zone to implement an adopted or approved current
County plan that was developed with public input.
b. Alternative #2: Change in Character of the Area. The proposed zoning district is more
appropriate than the existing zoning district because:
1.1.1.a.1.1) There has been a change in character or capacity of public facilities in the area (e.g.,
installation of public facilities, other rezonings, new growth trends, deterioration, development
transitions, etc.); and
1.1.1.a.1.2) The proposed zone allows for the reasonable development or redevelopment of the subject
property in a manner that will be compatible with its existing or planned context.
c. Alternative #3: Need for Zoning District to Increase Land Inventory. The proposed
zoning district is more appropriate than the existing zoning district because:
1.1.1.a.1.1) There is greater need in the County for land in the proposed zoning
district than the existing zoning district based on market conditions; and
1.1.1.a.1.2) The proposed zoning district will promote a balance of land uses in
the County that will improve economic opportunity or community mobility.

3. Standards for Administrative Modifications.
a. Setbacks. The Director may shall have authority to Administratively approve

1.1.1.a.1.2) The reduction of the setback will not reduce the spacing from one use to another where
such spacing is required;
1.1.1.a.1.3) The reduction of the setback is not used to change setback requirements that are imposed

b. Lot Area or Lot Width. The Director may approve an administrative modification to
lot area or lot width, or both, on a minor final plat in accordance with Chapter 3,
Section 1, Lot Dimensions by Zoning District.
c. Limitations. No administrative modification may be approved under this subsection

1.1.1.a.1.1) The proposed modification would require an amendment to a previously executed
agreement between the applicant and the County, or modify a condition or restriction placed on the
subject property by the County (unless the agreement is amended or the condition or restriction

the present use and enjoyment of, adjacent land;
1.1.1.a.1.3) The variation would create a material negative impact on public health or safety; or

development as to have no impact on the other elements of the approved development or
adjacent property, as determined by the Director, such site improvement shall not require
an administrative variation. Upon the property owner’s request, the Director shall
recognize in writing that a proposed improvement is de minimis. The de minimis exception
shall not be used in a manner such that its cumulative effect is to circumvent the application
of this Code.
Section 25. Variances

authorize variances.
Delta County Land Use Code Page
167
2. Standards and Limitations.
a. Findings. No variance shall be authorized unless the BOA finds all of the following:
1.1.1.a.1.1) Due to special circumstances applicable to the subject property, including the exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, or shape of the subject property on the effective date of this Code, or
exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition
of the subject property, the strict application of a regulation in this Code would result in peculiar
and exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardship upon, the owner of the
subject property is found to deprive subject property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in
the vicinity and under identical zone classification ; and
1.1.1.a.1.2) A variance from the strict application of the regulation at issue would relieve such
difficulties or hardship That the variance not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent
with the limitations upon other property in the vicinity and zone in which such property is
situated ; and
1.1.1.a.1.3) The requested variance would not create substantial detrimental to the public good or
substantially impair the intent and purpose of the Code. A variance shall not be granted for a use
or activity that is prohibited by this Code in the zoning district in which the subject property is
located.
b. In determining whether difficulties to, or hardship upon, the owner of a subject
property exist, as used in subsection (2)(a)1., findings above, the adequacy of access
to sunlight for solar energy devices installed on or after January 1, 1980, is a
permissible consideration.
c. Neither a nonconforming use of neighboring lands or structures in the same zoning
district, nor a permitted or nonconforming use of lands or structures in other zoning
districts shall be grounds for the issuance of a variance.
d. Under no circumstances shall the BOA grant a variance to allow a use that is
prohibited by this Code in the zoning district in which the subject property is
located.
3. Conditions of Approval. In granting any variance, the BOA may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Code and the DELTA COUNTY MASTER PLAN
and particularly the standards set forth in this Section. Violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be
deemed a violation of this Code and punishable as provided in Chapter 13, Enforcement.
4. Variances Run with the Land. Every variance shall transfer and run with the land.
5. No Precedent. The granting of any variance shall not constitute or be construed as a
precedent, ground or cause for any other variance.

1. Generally. The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove the location and extent of
any road,; park,; or other public way, ground, or space; public building or structure; or

commence or continue with construction. The period of such extensions shall be
determined by the Board of County Commissioners.
4. Administrative Extensions. Unless otherwise provided in the permit or approval, the
Director may grant one extension of any permit or approval for a period not to exceed the

1.1.1.a.1.1) There is good and reasonable cause for the request; and
1.1.1.a.1.2) The Applicant has provided reasonable assurances that it will
perform (or cause to be performed) the work authorized by the permit or
approval within the extended term.

7. Effect of Appeals, Litigation, or Mediation.
a. If there is an appeal, litigation, or mediation during the term of an approval granted
by the County that limits the applicant’s ability to use or develop land pursuant to
the permit or approval, then the term shall be tolled for the duration of the appeal,
litigation, or mediation, and the date shall be recalculated upon conclusion of the
appeal, litigation, or mediation.
b. The new expiration date shall be established by adding the number of days that the
approval would have remained valid before the appeal, litigation, or mediation
commenced to the date the appeal, litigation, or mediation was concluded by:
1.1.1.a.1.1) The expiration of the subsequent appeal period after final judgment
or order in the initial appeal or litigation, or, if no appeal is available, after
issuance of the final judgment or order; or

by the Director or upon application to the Director as follows:
a. Generally. The Director may approve an application to reform a scrivener’s error in
a development approval, including an error in an application or notice, which error
causes the permit or approval to inaccurately reflect the decision-maker’s intent,
and where it is demonstrated that:
1.1.1.a.1.1) The correction does not include a change of judgment, policy, or
prior intent of the decision-maker;

1.1.1.a.1.6) The error in the development approval did not mislead anyone in a
way that would cause them to be prejudiced by the reformation; and
1.1.1.a.1.7) Any errors related to public notice did not affect the legal sufficiency
of the required notice.
b. Correction within 30 Days. In the alternative, the Director, within 30 days of the
decision on an application for development approval, may correct a clerical or
scrivener’s error in the development approval if:
1.1.1.a.1.1) The error is not related to public notice;

meeting or hearing at which the application is considered, provided that it is withdrawn before
official action is taken on the application.
Section 3. Successive Applications
1. Generally. It is the policy of the County not to hear successive applications for the same
approval or permit after a substantially similar application is denied. The limitations of this
prevent the consideration of successive applications.

Chapter 10. Administrative Modifications, Variances, Boundary
Adjustments
Section 1. Administrative Modifications
A. Administrative Modifications and Reasonable Accommodations
6. Generally. The purpose of this is to provide a process to allow minor variations to
dimensional or numerical standards of this Code in order to:
a. Facilitate efficiency in the development review and approval process;
b. Facilitate development in accordance with development applications that have
received final approval; and
c. Allow for reasonable accommodations for disabled persons as required by Federal
law.
7. Authority of Director. The Director may approve, approve with conditions, or deny
administrative modifications or reasonable accommodations for any approvals and permits
originally approved administratively, and for legally nonconforming development. This
does not apply to situations where different amendment or modification procedures are
established in this Code.
8. Standards for Administrative Modifications.
a. Setbacks. The Director may approve administrative modifications to setbacks upon a
finding that:
1.1.1.a.1.4) The reduction of a setback is not more than 25 percent of the required setback;
1.1.1.a.1.5) The reduction of the setback will not reduce the spacing from one use to another where
such spacing is required;
1.1.1.a.1.6) The reduction of the setback is not used to change setback requirements that are imposed
to ensure compliance with Chapter 4 of this Code.
b. Lot Area or Lot Width. The Director may approve an administrative modification to
lot area or lot width, or both, on a minor final plat in accordance with Chapter 3,
Section 1, Lot Dimensions by Zoning District.
c. Limitations. No administrative modification may be approved under this subsection
(c) if:
1.1.1.a.1.5) The proposed modification would require an amendment to a previously executed
agreement between the applicant and the County, or modify a condition or restriction placed on the
subject property by the County (unless the agreement is amended or the condition or restriction
removed);
1.1.1.a.1.6) The variation would adversely affect reasonable development expectations related to, or
the present use and enjoyment of, adjacent land;
1.1.1.a.1.7) The variation would create a material negative impact on public health or safety; or
1.1.1.a.1.8) The variation would result in an encroachment that is prohibited by an easement, unless the
impacted easement holders have submitted a written authorization for the encroachment.
9. Reasonable Accommodations. The Director may authorize a reasonable accommodation
in order to allow for the administrative modification of standards of this Code in order to
afford a disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, compared to a
person who is not disabled, in accordance with applicable Federal Law.
10. De Minimus Modifications. If a proposed improvement is so minor in terms of the overall
development as to have no impact on the other elements of the approved development or
adjacent property, as determined by the Director, such site improvement shall not require
an administrative variation. Upon the property owner’s request, the Director shall
recognize in writing that a proposed improvement is de minimus. The de minimus exception
shall not be used in a manner such that its cumulative effect is to circumvent the application
of this Code.
Section 2. Variances
A. Variances
6. Generally. The Board of Adjustment (“ BOA”) may authorize variances from the
requirements of this Code, subject to terms and conditions fixed by the BOA. A variance
from the terms of this Code shall be considered an extraordinary remedy, and the
limitations set forth in subsection (2), below are intended to constrain the BOA’s power to
authorize variances.
7. Standards and Limitations.
a. No variance shall be authorized unless the BOA finds all of the following:
1.1.1.a.1.4) Due to the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of the subject property on the
effective date of this Code, or exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary and
exceptional situation or condition of the subject property, the strict application of a regulation in
this Code would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue
hardship upon, the owner of the subject property;
1.1.1.a.1.5) A variance from the strict application of the regulation at issue would relieve such
difficulties or hardship; and
1.1.1.a.1.6) The requested variance would not create substantial detriment to the public good or
substantially impair the intent and purpose of this Code.
a.1)In determining whether difficulties to, or hardship upon, the owner of a subject property exist, as
used in subsection (2)(a)1., above, the adequacy of access to sunlight for solar energy devices
installed on or after January 1, 1980, is a permissible consideration.
Delta County Land Use Code Page
187
b. Neither a nonconforming use of neighboring lands or structures in the same zoning
district, nor a permitted or nonconforming use of lands or structures in other zoning
districts shall be grounds for the issuance of a variance.
c. Under no circumstances shall the BOA grant a variance to allow a use that is
prohibited by this Code in the zoning district in which the subject property is
located.
8. Conditions of Approval. In granting any variance, the BOA may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Code and the Master Plan and
particularly the standards set forth in this Section. Violation of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be
deemed a violation of this Code and punishable as provided in Chapter 13, Enforcement.
9. Variances Run with the Land. Every variance shall transfer and run with the land.
10. No Precedent. The granting of any variance shall not constitute or be construed as a
precedent, ground or cause for any other variance.
Section 3. Boundary Adjustments
A. Boundary Adjustment:
1. Generally. Intended for adjustments or revisions of established, undisputed, existing
boundary lines between parcels not previously subdivided, and where such adjustment
does not result in the creation of an additional lot less than 35 acres.
2. Standards and Limitations.

acknowledge their agreement to permanently adjust a boundary lines(s) by their
signature on the final plat for the boundary line adjustment. All signatures must be
notarized.

Chapter 11. NONCONFORMITIES; DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
BODIES AND PROCEDURES
Section 1. Nonconformities
A. Purpose and Application of Section
1. Purpose of Section.
a. Generally. The application of this Code to existing development may create
circumstances in which existing land uses, buildings, structures, lighting, or parking
areas do not strictly conform to the Code’s requirements. For existing lots or
development (including uses, buildings, and structures) that are accordingly “legally
nonconforming,” this Section sets out equitable rules for whether, when, and how
the regulations of this Code apply.
b. Conversion of Nonconformities. Generally, nonconforming uses, buildings, and
structures are not allowed to be enlarged, expanded, increased, or used as grounds
for adding other uses, buildings, or structures that are now not allowed in the same
zoning district. This Section provides standards by which minor nonconforming
uses can be made “conforming” through a public hearing process.
c. Reduction of Nonconformities. It is the policy of the County to encourage
reinvestments in property that increase its value and utility and reduce its external
impacts. Since bringing a developed parcel into full compliance with this Code may
involve costs that may discourage reinvestment, Subsection (D), Other Physical
Nonconformities, provides a set of thresholds for determining when new
construction or modifications to development trigger a requirement for increasing
conformity with the various requirements of this Code.
2. Application of Section.
a. Generally. This Section applies to uses, buildings, structures, lighting, and parking
areas that were lawfully established, constructed, installed, planted, or created prior
to the effective date of this Code, but do not conform to the requirements of this
Code.
b. Effect of Section. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to require a change in
plans, construction, or designated use of any building, the construction of which
commenced prior to the effective date of this Code or subsequent amendment,
provided that construction.
c. Changes of Ownership. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affect or restrict
changes in ownership, nor shall changes in ownership affect the application of any
of the requirements of this Section.
d. Evidence of Status. Evidence that a nonconforming situation is a legal nonconformity
and not a violation of this Code shall be submitted by the owner of the property or
use upon request of the Director.
3. Exceptions to Section.
a. Existing Lots. Lots of record that were created prior to the effective date of this Code
are “conforming”, regardless of their lot area, lot width, frontage, or zoning district.
b. Approved Uses. Land uses that were approved pursuant to a specific development
approval pursuant to the Specific Development Regulations that were in effect prior
to the effective date of this CodeJanuary 5, 2021, are “conforming,” provided that
they continue to adhere to all applicable conditions of the approval.
c. Vested Rights. This Section does not apply to Site-Specific Development Plans for
which rights are vested, during the period of vested rights.
d. Natural Shifts of Zoning District Boundaries. If a zoning district boundary changes as
a result of a change in location of a river, stream, or ditch channel centerline, other
natural boundary-defining feature, or road, such change of boundary does not
render existing development nonconforming.
e. Taking for Public Use. Any nonconformity of a building, structure, or parking area
that is expressly created or caused by a conveyance of privately-owned land to a
Federal, State, or local government to serve a public purpose is conforming for the
purposes of this Code, and is not subject to limitations in this Section. This
exemption applies in cases where private land is obtained by a governmental entity
for a public purpose, through condemnation, threat of condemnation, or otherwise,
when that transaction creates a nonconformity in the remainder subject property in
terms of setback, parking area, or other standards of this Code. However, this
exemption does not apply to Right-of-Way dedication or other public conveyances
of land required by the County in the course of Subdivision, Site Plan, or other
development approvals.
4. Unlawful Uses, Buildings, or Structures.
a. Generally. This Section does not allow for the perpetuation of unlawful development.
Such development is not “legally nonconforming,” but instead, “unlawful,” and is
subject to all of the provisions of this Code (including enforcement provisions) and
any other applicable law.
b. Conversion to Lawful Use. If unlawful development becomes conforming on the
effective date of this Code or any amendments thereto, then it shall be considered
lawful development from that date forward, without prejudice to remedies that may
be available to the County for the period that the development was unlawful.
B. Nonconforming Uses
1. Generally. This applies to lawfully nonconforming uses.
2. Continuation of Nonconforming Use.
Delta County Land Use Code Page
191
a. Generally. Subject to the provisions of this, a nonconforming use may be continued
and maintained in reasonable repair, but shall not be altered or extended. The
extension of a nonconforming use to a portion of a building or structure that was
arranged or designed for the nonconforming use at the time of adoption of this Code
is not an extension of a nonconforming use.
b. Casualty Loss. If the building or structure in which a nonconforming use is
conducted is damaged to the extent that the cost of repair exceeds fifty-percent
(50%) of the appraised value of the subject property (including the building) for tax
purposes, then the nonconforming use of the property shall not be resumed.
3. Change of Nonconforming Use. If a nonconforming use is changed to a different use, the
new use shall be a use that conforms to the regulations of the zoning district in which the
use is located. After such change, all future use of the subject property shall comply with
applicable provisions of this Code.
4. Discontinuance of Nonconforming Use. If a nonconforming use is discontinued from use
for a period of twelve (12) months, further use of the subject property shall conform to the
requirements of this Code.
C. Nonconforming Buildings or Structures
1. Generally. This applies to lawfully nonconforming buildings or structures.
2. Modifications to Nonconforming Building or Structure. A building or structure that
contains a conforming use, but is nonconforming as to the applicable bulk requirements of
this Code, may be altered or extended, provided that the alteration or extension does not
increase the degree of nonconformity with this Code.
3. Completion of Building or Structure. Nothing contained in this shall require any change
in the plans, construction, alteration, or designated use of a building for which construction
work has commenced prior to the effective date of this Code. Such buildings may be
completed in accordance with plans, provided that completion of the buildings is diligently
pursued.
4. Damage to Nonconforming Building or Structure.
a. Cost of Repair is Fifty-Percent or More (50%+) of Appraised Value. If a nonconforming
building or structure is damaged to the extent that the cost of repair is fifty-percent
or more (50%+) of the appraised value of the subject property (including the

1. Generally. Clustered subdivisions can generally allow for smallera decrease in the size of
lots configuration and may allow for moreincrease in the number of lots than the minimum
from what is otherwise allowed by zoning in exchange for layout of clustered lots that are
designed to provided the County determines that the clustering of lots on a portion of the
subject property protects significant agricultural, natural, scenic, or archaeological
resources on the subject property and, if possible, to avoid natural hazards (including flood
hazards, wildfire hazards, and geologic hazards).
2. Design Objectives.
a. Clustered subdivisions shall have a defined stewardship objective or combination of
objectives based on either:
1.1.1.a.1.1) Protecting identified priority resources (e.g., forest stewardship,

mechanism that ensures irrigation will continue; or
1.1.1.a.1.3) Providing a large common open space amenity.
b. Stewardship Areas shall be interconnected within the subject property and to
comparable resources on adjacent properties, where such integration is practical
and tends to enhance the resource value of the Stewardship Areas.

(4) step process that emphasizes the protection of irrigated agriculture, natural resources
and meaningful open space:
a. Stewardship Areas shall be identified and mapped (See Chapter 4, Section 5;
Agricultural, Natural, and Cultural Resources and Chapter 4, Section 6; Geologic and
Wildfire Hazards). Stewardship Areas shall be designated as tracts.
b. All other areas outside of stewardship Areas located within designated building
envelopes are developable. Development areasBuilding envelopes shall be located
to (in descending order of priority):
1.1.1.a.1.1) Avoid flood hazards and geologic hazards;
1.1.1.a.1.2) Avoid or reduce wildfire hazards;
1.1.1.a.1.3) Avoid irrigated agricultural land;
1.1.1.a.1.4) Avoid impacts to critical wildlife habitat, calving areas, winter range,
and wildlife corridors;
1.1.1.a.1.5) Minimize the impacts of clearing and grading on riparian areas,
steep slopes, wetlands, and woodlands;
1.1.1.a.1.6) Minimize the visual impact of the cluster subdivision on the
landscape;
1.1.1.a.1.7) Provide contiguity of common open space, stewardship areas, and, if
present, agricultural lands (on-site and, where possible, off-site);
1.1.1.a.1.8) Preserve the open sky backdrop above ridgelines, as viewed from
public roads within one-quarter (¼) mile of the subject property; and
1.1.1.a.1.9) Provide open space and scenic views for the principal buildings in
the clustered subdivision.
c. The road system shall be designed to allow safe and efficient movement through the
subdivision, and to adjacent property as appropriate. The road system shall avoid
impacts to the Stewardship Areas to the maximum feasible extent. Road
classifications should be considered when allowing lots access to major County
Roads (Collector and Minor Arterial), including distance between driveways.
d. Lot lines and lot areas shall be established to provide for the most appropriate
conservation of the Stewardship Areas, and to optimize the design priorities set out
in Subsection (2), above.
5. Long-Term Maintenance. Financial surety or other mechanism for long-term maintenance
of Stewardship Areas shall be provided.
ED. Use of Stewardship Areas
1. Generally. Stewardship areas may be used for ecological, agricultural, recreational, utility
(underground and overhead lines), drainage (e.g., ponds, pipelines, swales, ditches, and
